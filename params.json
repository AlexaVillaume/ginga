In addition to this widget, the fits viewer provides a flexible plugin framework for extending the viewer with many different features.  A fairly complete set of \"standard\" plugins are provided for features that we expect from a modern viewer: panning and zooming windows, star catalog access, cuts, star pick/fwhm, thumbnails, etc.\r\n\r\n### Copyright and License\r\nCopyright (c) 2011-2012  Eric R.

Be sure to also check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga/wiki) and [FAQ](https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga/wiki/FAQ).\r\n\r\n### Bug reports?\r\nCheck out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga/issues).\r\n\r\n### Developers\r\nSee gtkw/example{1,2}.py and qtw/example{1,2}.py .  There is more information for developers in the manual.\r\n\r\n### Etymology\r\n\"Ginga\" is the romanized spelling of the Japanese word \"銀河\" (hiragana: ぎんが), meaning \"galaxy\" (in general) and, more familiarly, the Milky Way.  This viewer was written by software engineers at [Subaru\r\nTelescope](http://subarutelescope.org/), National Astronomical Observatory of Japan--thus the connection. \r\n\r\n### Pronunciation\r\nGinga the viewer may be pronounced \"ging-ga\" (proper japanese) or \"jing-ga\" (perhaps easier for western tongues).  The latter pronunciation has meaning in the Brazilian dance/martial art capoeira: a fundamental rocking or back and forth swinging motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
