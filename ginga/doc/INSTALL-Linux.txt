INSTALLATION ON LINUX (& other *ix)
---------------------
Install the necessary dependences (see below).

# apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib \
    python-pyfits python-pywcs python-gtk python-cairo python-webkit git

OR

# apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib \
    python-pyfits python-pywcs python-qt4 python-webkit git

(if you want to use the Qt version)

DOWNLOAD GINGA
-------------
Unpack Ginga to a directory in the filesystem.

$ git clone https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga.git ginga

Or you can download a zip file, tar file, etc. and unpack it.  If you
clone the git repo, however, you can easily track bug fixes and updates.

BUILD AND INSTALL GINGA
-----------------------
$ cd ginga
$ python setup.py install

RUNNING GINGA
-------------
$ ginga --stderr --loglevel=20

Change the level to 10 if you want debug information, and to 30 or 40 if
you want only warnings and error messages.  A log file can be specified
with --log=ginga.log if you prefer instead of --stderr.

Type 
$ ginga --help

for a list of command line options.


DEPENDENCES
-----------
Ginga is written entirely in Python, and only uses supporting Python
packages.  There is nothing to compile, unless you need to compile one
of the supporting packages.

On recent (2012) Ubuntu or other Debian-derived Linux distributions, the
following packages are sufficient for all functionality, and are in the 
standard repositories:

python-numpy
python-scipy
python-pyfits

Depending on which GUI toolkit you prefer, you will need either

python-gtk
python-cairo

OR

python-qt4

Certain plugins (or features of those plugins) will not work without the
following packages:

python-matplotlib (Pick, Cuts, Histogram)
python-webkit (WBrowser (online help))

It is highly recommended that you at least install matplotlib since it
enables some useful functionality.

Ginga uses a built in "bare bones" world coordinate system module.
However, it will use pywcs (a wrapper around WCSLIB) if you have it
installed.  If you are experiencing problems with correct WCS behavior I
highly recommend installing

python-pywcs
