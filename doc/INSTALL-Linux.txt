INSTALLATION ON LINUX (& other *ix)
---------------------
Install the necessary dependences (see below).

Unpack Ginga to a directory in the filesystem.  Set your PYTHONPATH
environment variable to the top-level directory where you unpacked
Ginga.  Run the program ginga.py from the directory or copy it to
another location in your $PATH.

RUNNING GINGA
-------------
Ginga will show useful information in a log file.  Run it from a
terminal like this:

$ ginga.py --stderr --loglevel=20

Change the level to 10 if you want debug information, and to 30 or 40 if
you want only warnings and error messages.  A log file can be specified
with --log=ginga.log if you prefer instead of --stderr.

Type 
$ ginga.py --help

for a list of command line options.


DEPENDENCES
-----------
Ginga is written entirely in Python, and only uses supporting Python
packages.  There is nothing to compile, unless you need to compile one
of the supporting packages.

On recent (2012) Ubuntu or other Debian-derived Linux distributions, the
following packages are sufficient for all functionality, and are in the 
standard repositories:

python-numpy
python-scipy
python-pyfits

Depending on which GUI toolkit you prefer, you will need either

python-gtk
python-cairo

OR

python-qt4

Certain plugins (or features of those plugins) will not work without the
following packages:

python-matplotlib (Pick, Cuts, Histogram)
python-webkit (WBrowser (online help))

It is highly recommended that you at least install matplotlib since it
enables some useful functionality.

Ginga uses a built in "bare bones" world coordinate system module.
However, it will use pywcs (a wrapper around WCSLIB) if you have it
installed.  If you are experiencing problems with correct WCS behavior I
highly recommend installing

python-pywcs
