Installation Instructions for Ginga
===================================

DEPENDENCES
-----------
Ginga is written entirely in Python, and only uses supporting Python
packages.  There is nothing to compile, unless you need to compile one
of the supporting packages.

On recent Linux, Mac and Windows versions, all of the packages are
available in binary (installable) form; it should not be necessary to
compile anything.  But as always, YMMV.

You will need:

python (v. 2.7 recommended)
python-numpy
python-scipy
python-pyfits

Also, depending on which GUI toolkit you prefer, you will need either

python-gtk
python-cairo

OR

python-qt4

(Mac and Windows platforms should probably install the Qt version,
unless you are adventurous.  Either one works fine on Linux.)

Certain plugins (or features of those plugins) will not work without the
following packages:

python-matplotlib (Pick, Cuts, Histogram)
python-webkit (WBrowser (online help))

It is highly recommended that you at least install matplotlib and scipy,
since there are extremely useful in their own right.

Ginga uses a built in "bare bones" world coordinate system module.
However, it will use pywcs (a wrapper around WCSLIB) if you have it
installed.  If you are experiencing problems with correct WCS behavior I
highly recommend installing

python-pywcs

We need help from someone who runs Mac and Windows and is skilled enough
to make better (e.g. all-in-one) installation packages!
Please contact eric@naoj.org if you can help.
