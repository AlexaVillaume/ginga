Installation Instructions for Ginga
===================================

DEPENDENCES
-----------
Ginga is written entirely in Python, and only uses supporting Python
packages.  There is nothing to compile, unless you need to compile one
of the supporting packages.

On recent (2012) Ubuntu or other Debian-derived Linux distributions, the
following packages are sufficient for all functionality:

python-numpy
python-pyfits

Also, depending on which GUI toolkit you prefer, you will need either

python-gtk
python-cairo

OR

python-qt4

Certain plugins (or features of those plugins) will not work without the
following packages:

python-matplotlib (Pick, Cuts, Histogram)
python-scipy (Pick)
python-webkit (WBrowser (online help))

It is highly recommended that you at least install matplotlib and scipy,
since there are extremely useful in their own right.

Ginga uses a built in "bare bones" world coordinate system module.
However, it will use pywcs (a wrapper around WCSLIB) if you have it
installed.  If you are experiencing problems with correct WCS behavior I
highly recommend installing

python-pywcs

INSTALLATION ON LINUX (& other *ix)
---------------------
Install the necessary dependences.

Unpack Ginga to a directory in the filesystem.  Set your PYTHONPATH
environment variable to the top-level directory where you unpacked
Ginga.  Run the program ginga.py from the directory or copy it to
another location in your $PATH.

INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS
-----------------------
Need help from someone who runs Windows and is skilled enough to get it
installed!  Please contact eric@naoj.org if you can help.

INSTALLATION ON A MAC
---------------------
Need help from someone who runs Macintosh and is skilled enough to get it
installed!  Please contact eric@naoj.org if you can help.

RUNNING GINGA
-------------
Ginga will show useful information in a log file.  Run it from a
terminal like this:

$ ginga.py --stderr --loglevel=20

Change the level to 10 if you want debug information, and to 30 or 40 if
you want only warnings and error messages.  A log file can be specified
with --log=ginga.log if you prefer instead of --stderr.

Please see the manual in doc/manual/manual.pdf for further information.
